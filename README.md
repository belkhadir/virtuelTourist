# virtuelTourist

An application that let you travel virtually to any place in the world with the help of the Flickr API. The idea is that you drop a pin to any location in the map and the app will let you view images from each location. The app will show a progress bar while it is downloading your photos on the collection view, if you want to see more pictures you can use the "New Collection" button. The app will remember the places where you dropped a pin on a previous trip.
